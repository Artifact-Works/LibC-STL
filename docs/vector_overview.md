# Vector Container Overview

The `Vector` container in LibC-STL is a dynamic array implementation providing:
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically grows as elements are added.
- **Constant Time Access**: Provides O(1) access for indexed elements.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Optimized for append operations.

It is similar to `std::vector` in C++ but is implemented for low-level usage.
